          <Text>Overview
Once you have processed your raw materials into refined materials you can the use these to manufacture MaterialKits, SpecializedParts or Colony Supplies. You can then use these to keep your colonies vital supplies stocked.
Workshop and Assembly Plant Modules will require a Kerbal with the engineer effect to be present in the vessel for peak operation (based on star level).
Agriculture Modules will require a Kerbal with the science effect to be present in the vessel for peak operation (based on star level).
All processes require their parts to be filled with machinery to reach 100% efficiency and will slowly consume machinery while outputting recyclables. Processes substituting Dirt for Substrate are much less efficient.</Text>

          <Text>Build a small satellite to put the M700 Survey Scanner into a polar orbit of the body you're looking for resources on. Be sure to include some decent EC storage solar panels and antenna.

Once established in an acceptable orbit, deploy the scanner and perform a scan. This will give you a basic idea of what resources are present, and where higher and lower concentrations are, though its not highly detailed.

Turn on the overlays in map mode, and find a spot that is bright in things you care about to choose an area for further exploration.

Land a rover with the narrow band scanner in the spot you chose.
Take a surface reading.

Look at narrow band scanner UI, find a spot with better concentrations of things you care about, drive/hop there
Repeat until you are feeling good and have found a suitable spot for your mining.

Land your base as close as you can to your rover.

Also includes more advanced modules like the Nuclear Fuel Processor. Fully self-sustaining bases are not possible without using Tundra Modules. Tundra modules do not have any landing leg’s which makes them perfect to us as space station parts. It is recommended to use the Cradles from USI Konstruction for horizontal placement or the included ‘Scout' Landing Module for vertical placement.</Text>

        <Text Name="Heading (15)">
          <Text>The resource detection generally used is the same stock resource detection method in KSP, and used in the same manner as for stock Ore, except we will be looking for different resources.
The stock system uses the same 3 parts to accomplish a full analysis of resources present on any planetary body in the Kerbol System. The M700 Survey Scanner and M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner are stock parts that can be used in a polar orbit to locate surface resources and concentrations and display them as an overlay on the map.
Simply put them in an acceptable orbit of the planetary body you wish to scan and then select the scanner on the vessel and cycle through which resource to display.
It will offer every resource it is capable of scanning for acess this information using Kerbnet.

The M700 is used to give a general idea of what resources are present, while the M4435 can also be used while landed and is used to give a slightly more detailed idea of how much is present. To get more exact readings on how high of a concentration of a resource is actually present, a Surface scanner such as the stock Surface Scanning Module must be used while landed.

UKS also works with SCANsat which offers a more immersive resource scanning experience and more detailed mapping options. Its a slightly more complex method than stock and has a few different options on how it can function.

See 'Scanning' for a step by step approach that outlines an approach to finding a nice area for resource extraction and base construction, as well as a few tips on what to look for in a site.

Things to look for in a site

Gypsum and Minerals will alow you to indefinitely extend your life support.
Either Ore or Karbonite is essential if you want to launch again, since you'll need a supply of LFO.
MetalicOre, Substrate, &amp; Minerals, in roughly equal quantities. All that matters is the lowest of the three, since that'll govern your industrial production.
RareMetals, ExoticMinerals &amp; Silicate in roughly equal quantities if you plan on increasing your industrial production to ship building and onsite construction.
Uraninite will be essential for advanced bases but can be ignored in your initial base.
Landing near (within 100 meters of) a biome border allows you to use proxy logistics to mine from 2 different biomes in one base. making a finding a high yield site easier/possible.</Text>

This will open the following window. From here you can control every joint individually.
You can also set parts into groups so they can all be controlled together. You set one to master ad the rest of the group to slave, then the whole group will follow the master. All parts have two modes, 'Free' and 'Goal'. In free mode they will move at the set speed until they reach their limit. In goal mode they will move at the set speed towards their set 'Goal'.

There is also an option to limit when the dock will engage. This allows you to preset the required orientation and the dock will not engage until the angle requirement is met.

The docks can then be 'collapsed' removing both docking ports and re-joining the parts on either side. This can greatly reduce part count when bases and stations are built in small sections.</Text>

          <Text>Umbra Space Industries introduces it's yellowest venture yet Konstruction! Konstruction adds new parts and game mechanics to KSP centered around base and orbital construction!

Weldable, configurable construction ports, with auto-rotation and configurable parameters on the fly. Once connected, these can be removed, resulting in a permanent joint between the parent parts of the two ports.

Design your assembly in the VAB, cut it up and add construction ports, reassemble in-situ.

Great for large bases and stations, or building larger vessels in orbit!
